How the code works?
The game system works with 3 diffrent kinds of pipes. The pipes loop over and over the pipes changes size increasing difficulty. This makes it so the game does not stop and get harder over time. The counter system work as everytime you pass through a pipe a point is gained while going through a pipe a coin sound is played. The high score is saved.
